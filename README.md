## Most Suckless

Our software is dedicated to the principles of simplicity, clarity, and frugality. We aim to counter the prevailing trend of complexity and inefficiency in the software industry.

We target the often overlooked advanced and technical users, providing them with minimalistic and efficient solutions tailored to their needs. The design of simple, yet elegant software is challenging but vital for reliability and maintainability.

Unfortunately, many developers equate the size of a codebase with skill and progress, leading to bloated, complex, and inconsistent software. Such complexity often harbors vulnerabilities and inefficient resource utilization. A major rewrite is usually the only solution, but this is seldom undertaken due to an unwarranted pride in complex code.

Our philosophy aligns with the Unix philosophyâ€”simplicity. We believe that the reduction of code lines is a genuine measure of progress, resulting in more effective and efficient software.

## More Suckless

We advocate for simplicity, clarity, and frugality in software, challenging the industry's complexity trend. Our tools are designed for advanced users, offering minimalistic yet efficient solutions. 

Many developers mistakenly believe that bloated code equates to progress, leading to inefficient and problematic software. We firmly uphold the Unix philosophy, asserting that simpler code is a true testament to skill and effective software.
